# Law-Detection-Using-NLP
The Judiciary system is one of the sectors in the world where a high number of text data is getting
generated day by day. These include First investigation report (FIR), legal articles, investigation
reports, rule book etc. All these generate a lot of information. In India, an offense is established on the
basis of Indian Penal Code (IPC). This IPC article serves as the main legal article for judgement of an
offense in our country. The IPC documents are only available in an unstructured nature which is used
manually by humans for judgemental references and for defining an offense.
The objective of our project is to computerize the whole procedure of understanding an offense and
determination of its IPC section. So, the unstructured data needs to be changed into a structured
specified format. This project develops a corpus for IPC documents which is then utilized for detection
of similarity between the keywords or description in the IPC document and the offence report. When a
text about an offense is given to the model it predicts the IPC section and corresponding punishment.
